# Number theory algorithms

The project contains implementations of Pollard's factorization algorithm, Pollard's solving of the discrete logarithm problem, computation of 
Euler's function, Mobius's function, Legendre's symbol, Jacobi's symbol, as well as Cipolla's algorithm for finding discrete square 
root. Additionally, the project demonstrates their functionality.
